# JumpNRun

In the past 5 years I have always been fascinated about games like Doodle Jump or Flappy Bird. Well, now I am trying to create my own Jump 'n' Run game.
At the moment it is more about trying things out to get used to the game development code structure than developing a game as straight and efficient as possible.
The FPS concept with the game loop and such stuff requires an completely different approach as far as programming is concerned. But don't worry, I am on the case!

Stay tuned!
